# LP Tools
This repository contains various command-line tools to enable link predictive analyses. Most are designed specifically to work with [LibKGE](https://github.com/uma-pi1/kge); these are stored in `py4libkge` and `bash4libkge`. Others, stored in `general`, are more widely applicable to network analysis but still work fine with LibKGE.

For more detailed descriptions of the tools, please see the nested `README` files.
