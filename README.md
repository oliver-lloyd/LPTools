# LP Tools
This repository contains various tools to enable link predictive analyses. Most are designed specifically to work with [LibKGE](https://github.com/uma-pi1/kge); these are stored in `py4libkge`. Others, stored in `general`, are more widely applicable to network analysis but still work fine with LibKGE.
